    <p id="milo"> Everything was perfectly swell.

       There were no prisons, no slums, no insane asylums, no cripples, no poverty, no wars.
       
       All diseases were conquered. So was old age.
       
       Death, barring accidents, was an adventure for volunteers.
       
       The population of the United States was stabilized at forty-million souls.
       
       One bright morning in the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, a man named Edward K. Wehling, Jr., waited for his wife to give birth. He was the only man waiting. Not many people were born a day any more.
       
       Wehling was fifty-six, a mere stripling in a population whose average age was one hundred and twenty-nine.
       
       X-rays had revealed that his wife was going to have triplets. The children would be his first.
       
       Young Wehling was hunched in his chair, his head in his hand. He was so rumpled, so still and colorless as to be virtually invisible. His camouflage was perfect, since the waiting room had a disorderly and demoralized air, too. Chairs and ashtrays had been moved away from the walls. The floor was paved with spattered dropcloths.
       
       The room was being redecorated. It was being redecorated as a memorial to a man who had volunteered to die.
       
       A sardonic old man, about two hundred years old, sat on a stepladder, painting a mural he did not like. Back in the days when people aged visibly, his age would have been guessed at thirty-five or so. Aging had touched him that much before the cure for aging was found.
       
       The mural he was working on depicted a very neat garden. Men and women in white, doctors and nurses, turned the soil, planted seedlings, sprayed bugs, spread fertilizer.
       
       Men and women in purple uniforms pulled up weeds, cut down plants that were old and sickly, raked leaves, carried refuse to trash-burners.
       
       Never, never, never--not even in medieval Holland nor old Japan--had a garden been more formal, been better tended. Every plant had all the loam, light, water, air and nourishment it could use.
       
       A hospital orderly came down the corridor, singing under his breath a popular song:

                Here's what I will do:
                I'll go see a girl in purple,
                Kiss this sad world toodle-oo.
                If you don't want my lovin',
                Why should I take up all this space?
                I'll get off this old planet,
                Let some sweet baby have my place.
